## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a traditional practice (e.g., berry picking, fishing, storytelling) is interrupted or transformed by silent surveillance tech. Focus on the character's internal conflict between honoring the ritual and performing for the lens.
- Create a conversation between a skeptical elder and a tech-savvy youth about the 'Shared Stewardship Accord.' The elder speaks in metaphors of relationship; the youth speaks in terms of data sovereignty and leveraging systems.
- Draft a 'confessional' monologue from Mark Devlin's perspective after a key encounter with Elara. Explore his genuine belief in 'technological care' and his blind spots.
- Imagine a discovery within the Terra-Vision data: an anomaly that their models can't explain, but that aligns perfectly with an oral history or legend of the community. Write the moment of realization.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative 'counter-surveillance' tool or practice from Elara's perspective. This could be a tech modification, a biological intervention (e.g., training birds to disrupt drones), or a data obfuscation ritual. Provide a concept and method.
- Propose a 'Land-Based API'—a set of protocols for interacting with the ecosystem that embeds Indigenous laws (like reciprocity, taking only what is needed) directly into the code structure of a monitoring platform. Outline key endpoints and ethical constraints.
